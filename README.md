## About

My toy widget to track paydays.

### Payday

The core logic that calculates when the next payday occurs.

### PaydayGui

The GUI interface that displays the next payday.

### DatePicker

Working on a unique way to set special days in the [DatePicker project](https://github.com/andreburto/DatePicker).

## To Do

1. Integrate DatePicker.
2. Refactor `Payday` to use `SpecialDate` class from DatePicker.
3. Simplify everything down to one app.
